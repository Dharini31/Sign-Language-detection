SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION USING HAND GESTURE

Project Overview:
The project revolves around creating a system for sign language detection using hand gestures. It involves capturing images from a camera, processing those images to extract hand landmarks using MediaPipe, creating a dataset of these landmarks, training a machine learning classifier (Random Forest), and using this classifier for real-time gesture recognition.
